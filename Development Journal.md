During this week I began to focus on the basics of my Unity game. I created my first project in Unity and followed along on the Roll a Ball tutorial. By using this tutorial, I began to learn how to use Rigid Body as a movement function. I also learned that shapes in Unity each have specific sizes and when you create objects it is often smart to reset them to origin. In addition, this tutorial showed me the basics of C # on Unity, and showed me how to access the Unity Help Page to find different commands that come preexisting on Unity (like RigidBody, Rotate, etc.). I also learned about how 3D things work in these types of games, and how the term transform relates not only to x, y, and z axis but also rotation. My platformer game will most likely be using many of the things that this game taught me. One of the less basic but still very important things I learned about was how to make objects able to be picked up and I gained knowledge about triggers, which are objects that toggle other events within games.
