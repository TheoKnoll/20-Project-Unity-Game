During this week I began to focus on the basics of my Unity game. I created my first project in Unity and followed along on the Roll a Ball tutorial. By using this tutorial, I began to learn how to use Rigid Body as a movement function. I also learned that shapes in Unity each have specific sizes and when you create objects it is often smart to reset them to origin. In addition, this tutorial showed me the basics of C # on Unity, and showed me how to access the Unity Help Page to find different commands that come preexisting on Unity (like RigidBody, Rotate, etc.). I also learned about how 3D things work in these types of games, and how the term transform relates not only to x, y, and z axis but also rotation. My platformer game will most likely be using many of the things that this game taught me. One of the less basic but still very important things I learned about was how to make objects able to be picked up and I gained knowledge about triggers, which are objects that toggle other events within games.

During this week I finished the Roll a Ball tutorial. In one of the tutorial videos, I learned how to incorporate text into Unity games. For the sake of the game the tutorial was making, the text was used to display how many objects you picked up, and also for when you have won the game after picking up all the objects. In the game I'm envisioning, text may not be important to the functionality, but for the sake of learning Unity and being able to create games in the future, it is good to know. Another thing that one of the tutorial videos taught me is how to build the game. I didn't realize it would be this easy, but all you have to do is select a platform which you want the game to be accessible on and then hit build and Unity will make a copy of it in a desired folder. I still need to figure out how to publish games online or make them available for download, but by using the build function if all else fails at least I could put the game on a flash drive and give it to my friends to download.
