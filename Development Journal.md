During this week I began to focus on the basics of my Unity game. I created my first project in Unity and followed along on the Roll a Ball tutorial. By using this tutorial, I began to learn how to use Rigid Body as a movement function. I also learned that shapes in Unity each have specific sizes and when you create objects it is often smart to reset them to origin. In addition, this tutorial showed me the basics of C # on Unity, and showed me how to access the Unity Help Page to find different commands that come preexisting on Unity (like RigidBody, Rotate, etc.). I also learned about how 3D things work in these types of games, and how the term transform relates not only to x, y, and z axis but also rotation. My platformer game will most likely be using many of the things that this game taught me. One of the less basic but still very important things I learned about was how to make objects able to be picked up and I gained knowledge about triggers, which are objects that toggle other events within games.

During this week I finished the Roll a Ball tutorial. In one of the tutorial videos, I learned how to incorporate text into Unity games. For the sake of the game the tutorial was making, the text was used to display how many objects you picked up, and also for when you have won the game after picking up all the objects. In the game I'm envisioning, text may not be important to the functionality, but for the sake of learning Unity and being able to create games in the future, it is good to know. Another thing that one of the tutorial videos taught me is how to build the game. I didn't realize it would be this easy, but all you have to do is select a platform which you want the game to be accessible on and then hit build and Unity will make a copy of it in a desired folder. I still need to figure out how to publish games online or make them available for download, but by using the build function if all else fails at least I could put the game on a flash drive and give it to my friends to download.

This week I began a new tutorial to become more comfortable with Unity. It is the Space Shooter tutorial. From the beginning, this was a significantly more advanced tutorial than the Roll a Ball tutorial. The first thing that I learned from this tutorial was how to import assets into Unity games. Because one of my goals is to not spend money, I will most likely have to be creating my own assets when it comes time to create my 3D Platformer. The next thing I learned about from the tutorial are colliders. Colliders are cages which wrap around game objects to give the RigidBody a set volume. They cages are used to detect collisions within the game, and relate a lot with triggers (the Roll a Ball tutorial briefly touched on triggers but didn't mention how to create the colliders, this tutorial did.) One tip that the tutorial gave me was to use primitive colliders if possible, because mesh colliders are apparently perform less consistently, although it didn't dive into any specifics.

This week will be a long journal, because I've found that by writing down what I learn I remember it better than just mindlessly walking myself through the tutorials, only to forget what I just learned. To start off this week, I began by continuing the Space Shooter tutorial. One video of this week taught me how to make backgrounds and effectively use textures. By using different texture types, you can allow your texture to be unaffected by lighting, which could be key in making a game attractive to the eye. It should also be noted that textures generally do better if they are moved far back from the game (this is in regards to 3D games played on a 2D plane (Like the Space Shooter game).) The next video I watched was about moving the player. Like the Roll a Ball tutorial, the movement in this game used the Rigidbody function. Through the tutorial I got much more comfortable with Rigidbody. In order to keep an object within certain bounds of the x, y, and z axis, you can use Mathf.Clamp. This tutorial also taught me what serializing is  (A way of storing information), and how to serialize classes you have made (this is done by putting [System.Serializable]; in the line above the class declaration). Unity needs properties serialized to view them in your inspector. The last thing this tutorial discussed was how to edit the rotation through scripting, which was simple so I won't go into more detail here. I watched one more tutorial this week, and it was related to shooting a beam from the ship. This particular video refreshed my knowledge of materials and prefabs, and had very simple coding to impliment, which is good to practice as I have no previous experience with C Sharp.
