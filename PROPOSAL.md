## Needs and Opportunities
Explain the problem you have noticed that needs to be solved with a project
like yours. This is also your hook, so make sure you grab our attention.

## Audience / Clients / Users
Explain who will benefit from your project. How will you be able to access
them for testing?

## Product
What is the actual product you will show this spring. This project may be made
of atoms or bits, but you must have something to show. I'm not interested
seeing a bunch of great ideas at the end of the year. I want to see things.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that\u2019s
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | Deliverable 1 |
| April 1       | Deliverable 2 |
| April 29      | Deliverable 3 |

## Reality Check
I am looking for moonshots here, but even moonshots need budgets. What
equipment are you going to need? What other capital expenditures do you
anticipate, and how will you meet them?

## Conclusion
Wrap it up. Why are you fired up about this project? Inspire us to support you,
and give us a great reason to approve your project.
